#### What is Kubernetes?
---
Kubernetes is a container management system developed in the Google platform. The purpose of Kubernetes is to manage a containerized application in various types of physical, virtual, and cloud environments. Google Kubernetes is a highly flexible container tool to deliver even complex applications, consistently. Applications run on clusters of hundreds to thousands of individual servers.

#### Define node in Kubernetes
---
A node the smallest unit of hardware. It defines a single machine in a cluster that can be a virtual machine from a cloud provider or physical machine in the data center. Every machine available in the Kubernetes cluster can substitute other machines.

#### What is the work of a kube-scheduler?
---
Kube-scheduler is the default scheduler for Kubernetes. It assigns nodes to newly created pods.

#### Define daemon sets
---
Daemon sets are a set of pods that runs on a host. They are used for host layers attributes like monitoring network or simple network.

#### Define Heapster in Kubernetes
---
A Heapster is a metrics collection and performance monitoring system for data that are collected by the Kublet.

#### What tasks are performed by Kubernetes?
---
Kubernetes is the Linux kernel which is used for distributed systems. It helps you to be abstract the underlying hardware of the nodes(servers) and offers a consistent interface for applications that consume the shared pool of resources.

#### Define Kubernetes controller manager
---
The controller manager is a daemon used for garbage collection, core control loops, and namespace creation. It enables the running of more than one process on the master node.

#### Why use namespace in Kubernetes?
---
Namespaces in Kubernetes are used for dividing cluster resources between users. It helps the environment where more than one user spread projects or teams and provides a scope of resources.

#### Why use Kubernetes?
---
Kubernetes is used because:

- Kubernetes can run on-premises bare metal, OpenStack, public clouds Google, Azure, AWS, etc.
- It helps you to avoid vendor lock issues as it can use any vendor-specific APIs or services except where Kubernetes provides an abstraction, e.g., load balancer and storage.
- It will enable applications that need to be released and updated without any downtime.
- Kubernetes allows you to assure those containerized apps run where and when you want and help you to find resources and tools which you want to work.


#### What are the features of Kubernetes?
---
The features of Kubernetes are:

- Automated Scheduling
- Self-Healing Capabilities
- Automated rollouts & rollback
- Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing
- Offers environment consistency for development, testing, and production

#### Explain Kubernetes Architecture
---
![Kubernetes-Architecture](https://www.guru99.com/images/1/061419_0430_KubernetesT1.png)

- Master Node: The master node is the first and most vital component which is responsible for the management of Kubernetes cluster. It is the entry point for all kinds of administrative tasks. There may be more than one master node in the cluster to check for fault tolerance.
- API Server: The API server acts as an entry point for all the REST commands used for controlling the cluster.
- Scheduler: The scheduler schedules the tasks to the slave node. It stores the resource usage information for every slave node. It is responsible for distributing the workload.
- Etcd: etcd components, store configuration detail, and wright values. It communicates with the most component to receive commands and work. It also manages network rules and port forwarding activity.
- Worker/Slave nodes: Worker nodes are another essential component that contains all the required services to manage the networking between the containers, communicate with the master node, which allows you to assign resources to the scheduled containers.
- Kubelet: It gets the configuration of a Pod from the API server and ensures that the described containers are up and running.
- Docker Container: Docker container runs on each of the worker nodes, which runs the configured pods.
- Pods: A pod is a combination of single or multiple containers that logically run together on nodes.

#### List various services available in Kubernetes
---

- and Stateful sets.

#### Define Stateful sets in Kubernetes
---
The stateful set is a workload API object that is used to manage the stateful application. It can also be used to manage the deployments and scaling the sets of pods. The state information and other data of stateful pods are store in the disk storage, which connects with stateful set.

#### Why use Daemon sets?
---
Daemon sets are used because:

- It enables to runs storage platforms like ceph and glusterd on each node.
- Daemon sets run the logs collection on every node such as filebeat or fluentd.
- It performs node monitoring on each and every node.

#### Why uses Kube-apiserver?
---
Kube-apiserver is an API server of Kubernetes that is used to configure and validate API objects, which include services, controllers, etc. It provides the frontend to the cluster's shared region using which components interact with each other.

#### Explain the types of Kubernetes pods
---
There are two types of pods in Kubernetes:

- Single Container Pod: It can be created with the run command.
- Multicontainer pods: It can be created using the "create" command in Kubernetes.

#### What are the labels in Kubernetes?
---
Labels are a collection of keys that contain some values. The key values are connected to pods, replication controllers, and associated services. Generally, labels are added to some object during its creation time. They can be modified by the users at run time.

#### What are the objectives of the replication controller?
---
The objectives of the replication controller are:

- It is responsible for controlling and administering the pod lifecycle.
- It monitors and verifies whether the allowed number of replicas are running or not.
- The replication controller helps the user to check the pod status.
- It enables to alter a pod. The user can drag its position the way interested in it.

---
Federated clusters multiple clusters that are managed as a single cluster.

#### Mention the difference between Docker volumes and Kubernetes Volumes
---
| Kubernetes Volumes | Docker Volumes |
| --- | --- |
| Volumes are not limited to any container. | Volumes are limited to a pod in the container. |
| Kubernetes volumes support all containers deployed in a pod of Kubernetes. | Docker volumes do not support all containers deployed in Docker. |
